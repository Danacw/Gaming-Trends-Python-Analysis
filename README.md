# Pandas-Challenge
UCD Data Analytics Bootcamp Pandas Challenge

For the Heroes of Pymoli Pandas Challenge, I used Jupyter Notebook to assess the spending trends of the games users. I created a variety of DataFrames analyzing trends based on demographics, revenue, most popular items, and more. I used Binning applications to assess age ranges and groupedby applications to assess gender and individual user trends. 

I noticed a few observable trends from this analysis. The first trend I noticed is that males dominate spending. Males spend nearly $2000 on items while females only spend $361 and non-disclosed genders spend $50. The next trend that stood out was that age groups follow a pretty normal distribution, with 15-19- and 20â€“24-year-old users spending the most on items. The third thing I noticed was that the most popular item was only purchased 13 times. Since this is a relatively small number, Heroes of Pymoli must not be a very popular game.
